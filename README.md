# Gait_Analysis
 This project develops a tool to synchronize video recordings of a subject's gait with accelerometer data to identify heel contact points. Users can manually mark these points during video playback, and the timestamps are saved for further analysis. The tool aids in assessing locomotion abnormalities in clinical, sports, and research settings.
